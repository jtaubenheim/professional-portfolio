This publicly available document defines the 8 services categories and 33 microservices required by enterprises in their IoT platforms.

Enterprises are using this functional architecture to:

- ensure IoT platform RFXs have the relevant product category questions

- create their use-case specific IoT solution architectures

- determine functionality gaps in current their current IoT platform product portfolio

No other IoT testing and benchmarking firm has the depth of knowledge about IoT platform middleware as MachNation. We have chosen to share our architecture with the ecosystem in order to create further clarity about the nature of IoT platforms and the components required for successful enterprise adoption.
