Hello from MachNation!

We hope everyone has had a great start to 2022 and much more to come! Thank you all for being a subscriber to our quarterly newsletter, and a big thank you to our partners!

2021 was a milestone year for MachNation with the official launch of our own internet-of-things (IoT) performance testing software, Tempest. Tempest is the industry’s first modern software solution for testing and validating the performance and scalability of IoT solutions for enterprises, service providers, and IoT platform vendors.

We’re currently running a new podcast series called Performance IoT to get the word out about how enterprise customers and IoT vendors can validate and test their solutions at-scale with tools like Tempest. If you’re an enterprise, service provider, or IoT vendor interested in talking more about IoT performance testing we’d love to have you on our show! Drop us a line via email or on our website if you’re interested in being featured in our next episode.

What else, whew…oh yea, MachNation’s 2022 IoT Device Management ScoreCard is in production and still accepting participants! If you’re an IoT DM vendor interested in participating in this 6-years-running annual study, please don’t hesitate to reach out! ScoreCard participation is FREE.
