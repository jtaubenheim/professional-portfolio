I’m Joshua (Josh) Taubenheim, a technical writer, project manager, and hardware hobbyist. I have worked in the technology industry for over 7 years helping development teams level-up their knowledge bases, creating compelling research content in the field of IoT, and innovating new ways for enterprise organizations to effectively manage their documentation workflows.

In my free time I like to visit the mountains of North Carolina, take walks with my Goldendoodle Archer, experiment new home automations with personal computing boards, and, most importantly, enjoy a movie with ice cream at the end of the day with my family.

I am currently seeking new opportunities to continue my career in this exciting and fulfilling field of work. If you’d like to discuss please don’t hesitate to reach out on LinkedIn or directly!
