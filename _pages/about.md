I’m Joshua (Josh) Taubenheim, a technical writer, project manager, and hardware hobbyist. From developer docs to blogs to just stuff I like to write about, it has been my life’s most fulfilling pursuit to create engaging and informative things that better those who read them. I created this space to archive some of my previous work and showcase the breadth of my interests.

In my free time I like to visit the mountains of North Carolina, take walks with my Goldendoodle Archer, experiment new home automations with personal computing boards, and, most importantly, enjoy a movie with ice cream at the end of the day with my family.

I am currently seeking new opportunities to continue my career in this exciting and fulfilling field of work. If you’d like to discuss please don’t hesitate to reach out on LinkedIn or directly!
